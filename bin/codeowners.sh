# DESCRIPTION
#   This script will produce a human and machine readable version of CODEOWNERS
#   ownership of a project.  It relies on `yq` and `codeonwers` CLI.
#
#   Converts output of codeowners CLI into YAML.  The YAML has two root keys.
#     - overall_approvers (optional; commented out if no overall approvers)
#     - codeowners_by_file (A list of zero or more files)
#
#   This script will create a codeowners.yaml file and determine overall
#   approvers.
#
#   This script will exit non-zero if no CODEOWNERS is available.  This is the
#   behavior of codeowners CLI.
#
# EXAMPLES
#
#   Get CODEOWNERS of current branch compared to origin/main
#     codeowners.sh
#
#   Get files to evaluate with CODEOWNERS from stdin

SYNOPSIS
  codeowners.sh [--skip-unowned-files] [-] [git-ref] [PASSTHROUGH...]


DESCRIPTION
  This script will produce a human and machine readable version of CODEOWNERS
  ownership of a project.  It relies on `yq` and `codeonwers` CLI.

  Converts output of codeowners CLI into YAML.  The YAML has two root keys.

    - overall_approvers (optional; commented out if no overall approvers)
    - codeowners_by_file (A list of zero or more files)

  This script will create a codeowners.yaml file and determine overall
  approvers.

  This script will exit non-zero if no CODEOWNERS is available.  This is the
  behavior of codeowners CLI.


ARGUMENTS
  --skip-unowned-files
    Skip files which are unowned (not covered by CODEOWNERS).

  - (hyphen)
    Read from stdin.  Ignored if PASSTHROUGH... provided.

  git-ref
    If no additinal args the git comparison will be against the provided
    git-ref.  Ignored if PASSTHROUGH... provided.

  PASSTHROUGH...
    Pass through one or more options directly as arguments to codeowners CLI.
    Additional arguments can be options for codeowners CLI or they can be files
    and folders for codeowners CLI to evaluate.


EXAMPLES

  Get CODEOWNERS of current branch compared to origin/main
    codeowners.sh

  Get files to evaluate with CODEOWNERS from stdin
    git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD | bin/codeowners.sh -

  Manually provide comparison ref for CODEOWNERS instead of origin/main.
    codeowners.sh upstream/main
    CODEOWNERS_REMOTE=upstream/main codeowners.sh

  Evaluate specific files or paths for CODEOWNERS ownership.
    codeowners.sh "some file" "another file"

  Read from stdin
    echo some_file | codeowners.sh -

  Skip unowned files in CODEOWNERS review.
    codeowners.sh --skip-unowned-files

  Read from stdin and skip unowned files.
    echo hello | codeowners.sh - --skip-unowned-files
